## Welcome to the Storewise Tech Screening Challenge

### Setup Instructions
- Ensure that you have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed in your machine
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the new directory (that you cloned)
- `pip install bullet`
- `python3 main.py` 

### Challenge Instructions

When you run `python3 main.py`,  you will enter the **McDonalds Shell** (_yumm_), here you can order some items and then finally the shell will show you the bill.

We need to ensure that the bill shows the correct amounts for `Order Amount`, `Service Charge`, and `Final Amount`.

That's all folks.
